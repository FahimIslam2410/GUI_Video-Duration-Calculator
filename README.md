# Video Duration Calculator

## Introduction

The Video Duration Calculator is a Python application with a graphical user interface (GUI) created using Tkinter and Bootstrap-themed widgets provided by `ttkbootstrap`. It allows users to input video durations in the format "mm:ss," calculates the total duration, and displays the list of input durations.

I designed this program as a practical exercise to develop my Tkinter skills and explore GUI development in Python.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The application provides a simple and intuitive interface for entering video durations and keeps a running list of input durations.
- **Real-Time Duration Total:** The total duration is calculated in real-time and displayed on the GUI as you add durations.
- **Validation:** The application validates the input format and provides visual feedback to the user.

## Usage

1. Enter the video duration in the format "hh:mm:ss" into the input field.
2. Click the "Add" button to add the duration to the list.
3. The list of input durations is displayed in the GUI.
4. The total duration is continuously updated and shown on the GUI.
5. If you enter an invalid duration format, the sub-title text will turn red and flash briefly to indicate an error.

## Getting Started

To run the application, you need Python installed on your system, as well as the `ttkbootstrap` package. You can install the required package using pip:

```bash
pip install ttkbootstrap
```

Once you have the necessary dependencies, run the application with the following command:

```bash
python video_duration_calculator.py
```

Replace `video_duration_calculator.py` with the actual filename of your Python script.
